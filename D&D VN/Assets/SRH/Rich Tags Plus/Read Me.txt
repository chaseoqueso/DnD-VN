Hey, this is a quick overview of Rich Tags Plus.
This asset allows you to write custom rich tags in either normal Text or TextMeshPro. Example: "Hello, <USERNAME>" becomes "Hello, SlushyRH".

How this asset works:
Create a Rich Tags scriptable object by right clicking in the project, Create/SRH/New Rich Tags. You can customise your rich text tags there! Then you need to add a TextParser component to each object with either a normal Text component or TextMeshPro component and when you have done that go and apply the rich text tags to all TextParses in the scene through the tool window SRH/Rich Tags.
Additionally, using the Rich Tags window, you can have multiple RichTagsText scriptable objects (one for each scene), this will save performance depending on how large your tags list is.

You can let the Text Parser change all the text on Awake or call ParseRichTags in TextParser to control when to parse the text (mainly for performance reasons).

IMPORTANT
Rich Tags Plus only allows you to replace the tags with text, so don't expect fancy effects or anything. If you are looking for that, I highly recommend looking for other assets then, if you just want to have colours, TextMeshPro allows that so you can use that.

Lastly, thanks for using Rich Tags Plus!
From, Slushy
